# Branching Website

#### By _**JuliaC652**_

#### _Practice Website That Incorporates CSS Stylesheets and Merged Code Branches_

## Technologies Used

* _A Computer_
* _GitBash_
* _Github.com_
* _A Web Browser_

## Description

_This website was created after a coding lesson that involved creating "branches" to view different CSS stylesheet options and then "merging" the "best" style onto the "main" branch and uploading it into JuliaC652's Github repository. It is a most fantastic and free practice tool-- tutorial accessed at www.learnhowtoprogram.com_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _A Computer_
* _A Web Browser_

_Accessing the finished product is no trouble so long as you have a computer and a web browser that can read .html files. However, practicing merging branches and the like can only be done once you've installed a program like gitbash (for PCs)._

## Known Bugs

* _I Disagree With the Final Style Choice, But I'm Still Too Indifferent To Change Anything_

_If you have questions and forgot how to look up the practice website that I keep rambling on about, feel free to contact me at JuliaC652@yahoo.com. I don't see why anyone would care enough to email me about a practice website, but whatever floats your boat._
